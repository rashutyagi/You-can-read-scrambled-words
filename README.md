# You-can-read-scrambled-words

In this repository using basic string manipulation we will see how we can read the scrambled words correctly when served in a specific format in a sentence.

For example - 

The String  - I have always wondered that will it be easy and fast to read a book if all the useless letters were removed from it

when served as - I hvae always werdneod taht wlil it be easy and fast to read a book if all the useelss ltreets were rveomed form it

Still remains readable.
